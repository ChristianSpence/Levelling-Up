# Levelling-Up

A open-source project to bring together data for levelling-up metrics

## Background

The UK government's [Levelling Up the United Kingdom White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom) was published on 2 February 2022.

This project aims to bring together and automatically update the relevant data for each of the metric in the white paper by lowest geography possible and show progress against these metrics at the highest frequency possible.

> This project will maintain all of its work, progress, code and analysis fully open throughout.

# Key points from the White Paper

Five pillars, six capitals, twelve missions and a whole bunch of metrics ...

## The five pillars

1.  a mission-oriented approach to setting policy;
2.  a reorientation of central government decision-making;
3.  greater empowerment of local government decision-making;
4.  a revolution in data and transparency at the subnational level; and
5.  enhanced transparency and accountability of this new regime.

## The six capitals

#### Human capital

#### Financial capital

#### Social capital

#### Physical capital

#### Intangible capital

#### Institutional capital

## The twelve missions

### Boost productivity, pay, jobs and living standards by growing the private sector, especially in those places where they are lagging

#### 1. Living Standards

By 2030, pay, employment and productivity will have risen in every area of the UK, with each area containing a globally competitive city, and the gap between the top performing and other areas closing.

*How will this mission be measured?* The traditional metric for measuring living standards is GDP per capita, but when looking at sub-national data, this metric can obscure factors, such as commuting flows, that distort the picture. To take a more rounded view of living standards, this mission will look at GVA per hour, median pay and employment rates. These three metrics are all strongly linked to GDP, but provide a richer suite of measures relevant to tracking living standards, which may perform differently in different places. These metrics will be measured over ITL1 areas. Some supporting metrics, including the economic activity rate, will be measured at the local authority level, which will ensure that the disparities that exist within city regions are also taken into account. Measuring globally competitive cities requires capturing a range of underpinning metrics, including GVA per filled job, services trade balance, the share of Knowledge Intensive Service sectors, the percentage of 16 – 64 year olds with an NVQ4+ qualification and city density, across city regions. Further work will be undertaken, in consultation with external stakeholders, to develop and refine these metrics.

#### 2. Research & Development (R&D)

By 2030, domestic public investment in R&D outside the Greater South East will increase by at least 40%, and over the Spending Review period by at least one third. This additional government funding will seek to leverage at least twice as much private sector investment over the long term to stimulate innovation and productivity growth.

#### 3. Transport Infrastructure

By 2030, local public transport connectivity across the country will be significantly closer to the standards of London, with improved services, simpler fares and integrated ticketing.

#### 4. Digital Connectivity

By 2030, the UK will have nationwide gigabit-capable broadband and 4G coverage, with 5G coverage for the majority of the population.

### Spread opportunities and improve public services, especially in those places where they are weakest

#### 5. Education

By 2030, the number of primary school children achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths will have significantly increased. In England, this will mean 90% of children will achieve the expected standard, and the percentage of children meeting the expected standard in the worst performing areas will have increased by over a third.

#### 6. Skills

By 2030, the number of people successfully completing high-quality skills training will have significantly increased in every area of the UK. In England, this will lead to 200,000 more people successfully completing high quality-skills training annually, driven by 80,000 more people completing courses in the lowest skilled areas.

#### 7. Health

By 2030, the gap in Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) between local areas where it is highest and lowest will have narrowed, and by 2035 HLE will rise by five years.

#### 8. Well-being

By 2030, well-being will have improved in every area of the UK, with the gap between top performing and other areas closing.

### Restore a sense of community, local pride and belonging, especially in those places where they have been lost

#### 9. Pride in Place

By 2030, pride in place, such as people’s satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community, will have risen in every area of the UK, with the gap between top performing and other areas closing.

#### 10. Housing

By 2030, renters will have a secure path to ownership with the number of first-time buyers increasing in all areas; and the government’s ambition is for the number of non-decent rented homes to have fallen by 50%, with the biggest improvements in the lowest performing areas.

#### 11. Crime

By 2030, homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime will have fallen, focused on the worst affected areas.

### Empower local leaders and communities, especially in those places lacking local agency

#### 12. Local Leadership

By 2030, every part of England that wants one will have a devolution deal with powers at or approaching the highest level of devolution and a simplified, long-term funding settlement.

\(E\) metrics are exploratory and may change.

\* statistics are only available for England or available for all/some UK countries and regions but are not coherent.

\*\* metric is currently unavailable. Work will be undertaken by government departments to address these data gaps.

† Estimates for 5G are not available on a regular basis and will replace 4G once data is published frequently and at a lower geographical level.

‡ statistics are available for the UK and at local authority level but only at the national level for Northern Ireland.
